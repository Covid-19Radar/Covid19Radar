# COVID-19Radar (English)/([Japanese](README.ja.md))

â€œThere is only one version of contact confirming app in app stores - the official version by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. This GitHub contains code that became the base for the official app, but it is not the same as the code for the official app itself.
This code is maintained by the community and there is no guarantee that issues or pull requests will be reflected in the official app."

Now, We move to GitHub Org [Project Covid19Radar](https://github.com/Covid-19Radar)

We are looking for translator reviewers, Please see [How to Translate application](HOW_TO_TRANSLATE_CONTRIBUTE.md) page.
